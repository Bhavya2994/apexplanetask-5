Final Project and Optimization Web App

## 📌 Objective

This project is a comprehensive final web application developed to integrate and demonstrate all key web development skills acquired throughout the course. The goal is to create a fully functional, performant, responsive, and cross-browser compatible web app. The project has been built using core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- ✅ Develop a dynamic and interactive web application (e.g., blog, e-commerce site, or advanced portfolio).
- ✅ Apply clean and modular code structure for maintainability.
- ✅ Optimize performance and ensure responsiveness across various devices.
- ✅ Guarantee browser compatibility and accessibility.
- ✅ Host and maintain version control via GitHub.
